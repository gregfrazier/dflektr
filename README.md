Basic port forwarding software, compiles in Windows, Linux, and OS X -- probably more

I used Visual Studio 2010, but also works with plain old g++.
For OS X, just drop the .cpp/.h files into a new XCode project and compile it.
May need to link with a sockets lib, but I can't remember.

Makefile added.

Originally was designed to snoop on telnet sessions and hook other applications into the feed, but that never came to fruition.
